/* hello! this is a super cool program that deals with car loans and payments. 
as a result, we are dealing with the actual car loan, the length of the loan, 
the interest rate, and the down payment. there are three options: maybe you 
accidentally create an invalid car loan, or you have enough to pay for the entire 
car, or if you don't, you need to know your monthly payment. this program has it all! :) */
